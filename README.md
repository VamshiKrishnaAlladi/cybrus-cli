### **About Cybrus:**
Cybrus is a CLI app that ends your ultimate quest for the answers.

Yeah you can ask anything, and cybrus answers everything.

You can ask cybrus anything like,

> who is the person sitting beside me?

> when was the last time I had a Cotton Candy?

> What is the color of the dress Jane was wearing on the high school prom-night 6 years back?

> who is mitchelle dating now?

And you will get your answers for every single question.

How does cybrus do that?

- Is it a Trick?
- Is it a bot?
- Does it have access to your Facebook account?
- Is one of your friends helping it to answer?
- Is it the Terminator franchise's Skynet?

**Maybe it is. _Maybe it is not._**

Psst!, Here is the secret. It is a Prank! 😜

Yes, I said it. It is a PRANK. ( It is intended to be, at first place. )

> **Note:** Cybrus is still _Work-In-Progress_.
